# Photo Gallery

A responsive photo gallery web page built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of my front‑end development projects. This page demonstrates image layout techniques, user interaction, and responsive design.

## Overview

This repository contains the source files for a **Photo Gallery** application that displays a collection of images in a visually appealing layout. Users can browse through photos, and the gallery adapts to different screen sizes. The project highlights core front‑end skills in layout, styling, and interaction using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

✔ Grid layout for image gallery  
✔ Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes  
✔ Interactive elements using JavaScript  
✔ Clean and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for page structure and content  
- **CSS3** – for layout and responsive styling  
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity and dynamic behavior

## How It Works

1. **HTML** defines the gallery structure with image elements and containers.  
2. **CSS** styles the grid layout, spacing, and responsive behavior.  
3. **JavaScript** adds interactivity — such as image enlargement or effects when clicked — enhancing user engagement.

This project demonstrates practical use of DOM manipulation, responsive layout techniques, and visual presentation skills.
